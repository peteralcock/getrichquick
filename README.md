# NFL Prop Bet Generator 

![GetRichQuick](getrichquick.png?raw=true "getrichquick")

This repository provides an AI-driven tool for generating creative NFL prop bets based on real-time NFL news headlines. The system uses RSS feeds, natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and OpenAI's API to produce prop bets related to NFL players, with accompanying odds and betting recommendations.

## Features

- **Headline Aggregation**: Gathers NFL news headlines from a list of top RSS feeds.
- **Player Identification**: Uses NLP (spaCy) to extract player names from headlines.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment in each headline related to the player to calculate an overall sentiment score.
- **AI-Generated Prop Bets**: Creates unique prop bets using OpenAI's API based on each headline.
- **Database Storage**: Stores player data, headlines, sentiment scores, and generated prop bets in an SQLite database.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/nfl-prop-bet-generator.git
   cd nfl-prop-bet-generator
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install feedparser spacy textblob openai
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key**:
   Replace `sk-proj-3c39_W2Vsa...` with your own OpenAI API key in the `client` initialization.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script to fetch headlines, process player names, analyze sentiment, and generate prop bets.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Check Output**:
   - **Player profiles**: Displays each player's headlines and overall sentiment score.
   - **Generated Prop Bets**: Prop bets generated by the AI are stored in the SQLite database (`nfl_players.db`), under the `prop_bets` table.

## Database Structure

- **`players` Table**: Contains unique player IDs and aggregated sentiment scores.
- **`headlines` Table**: Stores headlines associated with each player.
- **`prop_bets` Table**: Contains AI-generated prop bets linked to each player and headline.

## Example Workflow

1. **Fetch Headlines**: Retrieves NFL headlines from specified RSS feeds.
2. **Identify Players**: Extracts player names using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Computes a sentiment score for each player based on their headlines.
4. **Generate Prop Bets**: Uses OpenAI API to generate three creative prop bets for each headline related to a player.
5. **Save Results**: Stores data in an SQLite database.

This tool is intended for entertainment purposes only and should not be used as a primary betting guide. Gambling carries financial risks, and prop bets generated are speculative.
