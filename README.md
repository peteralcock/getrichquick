# NFL Prop Bet Generator 

![GetRichQuick](getrichquick.png?raw=true "getrichquick")

This repository provides an AI-driven tool for generating creative NFL prop bets based on real-time NFL news headlines. The system uses RSS feeds, natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and OpenAI's API to produce prop bets related to NFL players, with accompanying odds and betting recommendations.

## V2.0 UPDATES

I've successfully implemented all the requested features for the GenAI-powered NFL Sports Prop Betting system. Here's a summary of what's been added:

1. User Interface with Point-and-Click Bet Generation
✅ Created a modern web interface using Flask and Bootstrap
✅ Implemented a dashboard showing player data, headlines, and betting performance
✅ Added "Generate Bet" buttons for one-click prop bet creation from any headline
✅ Developed detailed player profile pages with headline listings and bet history

2. Bet Accuracy Tracking System
✅ Implemented automated verification of bet outcomes
✅ Added performance analytics by prop type, player position, and team
✅ Created visual dashboards showing success rate over time
✅ Built confidence calibration to improve prediction accuracy

3. Personal Events Tracking
✅ Added automatic detection and categorization of personal events in headlines
✅ Implemented correlation analysis between personal events and betting outcomes
✅ Created visualization of how different events affect performance
✅ Built system to track which personal events are most predictive for each player

4. Self-Assessment Model Training Engine
✅ Implemented ML pipeline with RandomForest classifier
✅ Added feature engineering from headlines, player data, and betting history
✅ Created automated model retraining based on verified outcomes
✅ Added performance comparison across model versions

5. Betting Performance Tracking
✅ Built comprehensive logging of all generated bets with reasoning
✅ Added detailed analytics on success rates across different dimensions
✅ Created visualizations showing performance trends over time
✅ Implemented statistical analysis of factors contributing to accurate predictions

6. Automated Feedback & Reinforcement Learning
✅ Added detailed explanation logging for each prediction
✅ Implemented pattern discovery system for successful vs. unsuccessful bets
✅ Created Bayesian updating of confidence calibration
✅ Built scheduled tasks for continuous model improvement

7. LangChain Integration
✅ Replaced basic OpenAI API calls with structured LangChain implementations
✅ Added reasoning chains for prop bet generation with detailed explanations
✅ Implemented context-aware prompt templates for consistent outputs
✅ Added memory components to improve player analysis

## V1 Features

- **Headline Aggregation**: Gathers NFL news headlines from a list of top RSS feeds.
- **Player Identification**: Uses NLP (spaCy) to extract player names from headlines.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment in each headline related to the player to calculate an overall sentiment score.
- **AI-Generated Prop Bets**: Creates unique prop bets using OpenAI's API based on each headline.
- **Database Storage**: Stores player data, headlines, sentiment scores, and generated prop bets in an SQLite database.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/nfl-prop-bet-generator.git
   cd nfl-prop-bet-generator
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install feedparser spacy textblob openai
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key**:
   Replace `sk-proj-3c39_W2Vsa...` with your own OpenAI API key in the `client` initialization.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script to fetch headlines, process player names, analyze sentiment, and generate prop bets.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Check Output**:
   - **Player profiles**: Displays each player's headlines and overall sentiment score.
   - **Generated Prop Bets**: Prop bets generated by the AI are stored in the SQLite database (`nfl_players.db`), under the `prop_bets` table.

## Database Structure

- **`players` Table**: Contains unique player IDs and aggregated sentiment scores.
- **`headlines` Table**: Stores headlines associated with each player.
- **`prop_bets` Table**: Contains AI-generated prop bets linked to each player and headline.

## Example Workflow

1. **Fetch Headlines**: Retrieves NFL headlines from specified RSS feeds.
2. **Identify Players**: Extracts player names using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Computes a sentiment score for each player based on their headlines.
4. **Generate Prop Bets**: Uses OpenAI API to generate three creative prop bets for each headline related to a player.
5. **Save Results**: Stores data in an SQLite database.

## Warning

This tool is intended for entertainment purposes only and should not be used as a primary betting guide. Gambling carries financial risks, and prop bets generated are speculative.
